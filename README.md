## roadmap
- Coursera lectures
    - [x] lesson 1 2D kinematic modelling
    - [x] lesson 2 Kinematic bicycle model
- Controller impl.
    - [x] Conv, Relu needed?
        - Probably not. Since for the input (x, y, th, xg, yg) probably there no local relations or sequential memory required.
        - A simple strategy would be to orient towards goal. True theta can be obtained by a function of (x, y, xg, yg). w and v can be given to reduce theta reside and distance residue.
    - [x] Variable number of dynamic dof layers.
    - [x] Per layer activations.
    - [x] Random param initialization.
    - [x] Make ceo() a struct.
    - [x] Seperate bin crate for each network.
    - Speedup
        - [x] Parallelize.
        - [ ] Maybe move generation logic inside model? Removes into shapes a lot that way.
        - [ ] Use 8 core machine for training.
    - [x] sin().
    - [x] exp().
    - [ ] median().
